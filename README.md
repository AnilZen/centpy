# centpy
Central schemes for conservation laws in Python.

The schemes are translated into Python from [CentPack](https://home.cscamm.umd.edu/centpack/) written by [Jorge Balb√°s](http://www.csun.edu/~jb715473/index.htm) and [Eitan Tadmor](https://home.cscamm.umd.edu/people/faculty/tadmor/).

The repository currently has a single jupyter notebook for experimentation and demonstration. I am planning to create a solver package in the next few months.
